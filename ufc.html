              Skyloom’s work with UFC Fight Pass in 2020/21 delivered a 30%
              increase in subscriptions at a cost per acquisition (CPA) 60%

            <p class="para">
              However, new challenges quickly emerged in 2022, calling for an
              adapted strategy. Russia’s invasion of Ukraine brought sanctions –
              most notably the freezing of the SWIFT payment system in Russia –
              that would translate into a projected 25% loss in the subscriber
              base in a core UFC market and hit projections for growth in the
              year ahead.
            </p>
            <p class="para">
              Rising gas prices that resulted from the conflict also accelerated
              a global cost of living crisis, increasing pressure on consumer
              spending power and making discretionary purchases such as OTT
              subscriptions less attractive to general audiences. This was
              especially problematic in markets with solid UFC coverage
              elsewhere through media rights partners.
            </p>
            <p class="para">
              This necessitated a recalibrated campaign with a focus on highly
              engaged UFC fans in historically underserved territories.

          <p class="section_title">The Solution</p>
          <div class="section_description">
            <p class="para">
              We began by filling out the picture of the UFC’s international
              audience using platform, panel-based and partner insights.
            </p>
            <p class="para">
              The goal was to identify territories with a strong UFC and mixed
              martial arts (MMA) fanbase. However, we wanted to prioritise
              markets with low barriers to entry for a dedicated SVOD product –
              such as an absence of local TV deals – and where UFC Fight Pass
              would be produced in local languages and carry coverage of MMA
              events from regional partners.
            </p>
            <p class="para">
              We then overlaid a consolidated list of target markets with those
              where core biddable platforms from companies like Meta and Google
              were in heavy use. We also planned campaigns that would reach
              those markets at moments of peak interest in UFC Fight Pass, such
              as in the build-up to major fight nights or locally relevant
              promotions such as UFC London.
            </p>
            <p class="para">
              Creative assets were adapted to foreground regional stars like
              Israel Adesanya in Australia or Paddy Pimblett in the UK, while
              social content was also translated into the languages that UFC
              Fight Pass was available in locally.
            </p>
            <p class="para">
              We then optimised campaigns to enable more effective retargeting,
              prioritising social and search platforms that had historically
              delivered better conversion rates. We developed video content at
              three different lengths for the first half of 2022 – at 15
              seconds, 30 seconds and 60 seconds – and used watch times to sort
              tagged viewers by levels of engagement.
            </p>
            <p class="para">
              We then retargeted those viewers with paid social campaigns and
              programmatic videos to turn the strongest prospects into
              subscribers.
