                9Five was winning. They had the ultimate advantage:
                Product-market fit. The Greek market was responding well to the
                brand’s modern designs and lifestyle-first marketing approach.
                However, the challenge was that the store’s growth was largely
                fueled by the Founder, who was strong in media buying. That put
                a hard limit on the brand’s potential to grow.
              </p>
              <p class="para">
                The ads were impossible to scale after a certain volume.
                Exploring new channels like YouTube and Google Ads wasn’t going
                as smoothly as 9Five hoped, and growth was starting to halt.
                When we started working with the brand, we decided we’d focus on
                tackling two main challenges.
              </p>
            </div>
          </div>
          <div class="solution each_main_description_block">
            <p class="section_title">The Solution</p>
            <div class="section_description">
              <p class="para">
                First, we’d make the email marketing channel a big revenue and
                profit contributor. This added cash in the pocket would then
                allow the brand to reinvest more in advertising, scale its
                social, and diversify in new channels more effectively.
                Secondly, we’d do everything in a fully automated way. Not just
                the core automation like cart and checkout abandonment. But also
                more advanced journeys, such as passive user research, review
                collection, and even highly personalized, plain-text “check-up”
                campaigns (a shockingly underutilized technique to enhance the
                shopper’s experience and boost deliverability).
              </p>
              <p class="para">
                A huge buying block for shopping for sunglasses online is the
                inability to know whether they’d fit your face without trying
                them on. Working together with the brand, we developed an
                on-site “quiz-like” experience that allowed the users to select
                the most appropriate glasses based on their facial bone
                structure and gender.
              </p>
              <p class="para">
                It was a campaign that matched the user’s needs perfectly. Even
                though we hacked it together in a couple of hours using nothing
                more than WordPress’s Elementor Pro, the results speak for
                themselves.
              </p>
              <p class="para">
                The campaign topped at a 38% conversion rate and averaged a
                20.5% conversion rate over a 7-month period, But here’s the best
                part. We used this opportunity to also collect zero-party data
                from the subscribers. In the future, this means we’d be able to
                make personalized recommendations based on the user’s gender and
                facial structure.
              </p>
              <p class="para">
                We created the core e-commerce flows. This included retargeting
                automation, such as cart and browse abandonment flows. It
                included onboarding journeys for new subscribers and
                post-purchase sequences that ensured the shopper’s expectations
                were met. The difference is in how we executed this automation.
              </p>
              <p class="para">
                Online shopping lacks the human touch offered in
                brick-and-mortar stores. Apart from that, when it comes to
                eyewear specifically, each subscriber has different needs and
                styles. Even though the price point is not high, there is
                anxiety.
              </p>
              <p class="para">
                The way we alleviated that anxiety was through highly
                personalized content. The automation pushed new sales, yes, but
                they also checked how the shopper was doing, whether they were
                happy with their purchase, what new products the brand ought to
                develop, and more.
              </p>
              <p class="para">
                The Greek e-commerce market is thriving but years behind in
                marketing innovation. This was a highly unusual experience for
                Greek shoppers. They responded in an extremely positive way.
                First, by shopping. In as little as 90 days, email marketing was
                contributing 20% to the store’s total revenue. Secondly, by
                replying to the brand’s emails, giving feedback, reviewing
                products, and actively engaging with the brand’s content in
                other channels.
